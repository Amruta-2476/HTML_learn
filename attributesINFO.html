<!-- All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" 
eg:  href="https://www.w3schools.com"

1) The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
    
2) The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
Absolute path - starts with / or http:// or https:// (recommended for external files)

3) <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"> width and height attributes

4) The ALT attribute for the <img> tag specifies an ALTERNATE TEXT FOR THE IMAGE, IF THE IMAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED DUE TO SLOW CONNECTION, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

5) The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

6) You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>...

7) The TITLE attribute defines some extra information about an element.
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip (display informative text when users hover over, focus on, or tap an element):
<p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>

The HTML <PRE> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
Example
<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>-->
